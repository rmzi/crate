### What

Your crate is yours. Own it, share it. It's just music.

Crate is a self-hosted streaming platform born from
[36247 Redux](https://github.com/rmzi/36247) — a revival of
[fffff.at/36247](https://fffff.at/36247/), originally built by
[F.A.T. Lab](https://fffff.at/about/).
In an era where platforms monetize our relationship to culture, Crate lets you
own the means of distributing your music. No accounts, no tracking, no algorithms.

### Why

F.A.T. Lab said it best: release early, often and with rap music. Their original 36247 was a
24/7 Three 6 Mafia player — infinite tracks at your convenience, curation in the admin's hands,
control in the user's. It rejected the idea of a big institution owning the means of distributing music.

Crate carries that forward. It's open source, white-labelable, and virtually free to operate.
Drop in your catalog. Deploy. Stream. That's it.

### How

**Space** to play/pause, **N** for next track,
**←/→** to seek. The site remembers what you've heard and plays new tracks first.
